**Hoodoo** is a unique WordPress themeing framework with a built in ability to quickly build pages by utilizing pre-built components and templates. This in itself is not unique but Hoodoo ships with ACF which was utilized to allow frontend editing of all content. 

##Long Term Goal - WordPress as a CMS
The long term goal for Hoodoo is to have a client ready website built very quickly, and allow the client to stay on the frontend and to leave your wonderful configs and settings alone..plus its just less confusing for non-WordPress users.
