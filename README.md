# DEPRECATED - this framework is unfinished and will not be worked on moving forward
...sometimes I just like to look back at old code :)

# Hoodoo WordPress Framework 0.1.0

Hoodoo is a WordPress Framework build for quick templating of custom themes and also a built in Front-end editing system utilizing ACF Plugin (acf_form function).

## What is Hoodoo

>### hoo·doo
> ˈho͞oˌdo͞o
> 
> noun
> 
>  1. voodoo; witchcraft.
>  
> verb
> 
>  1. bewitch.
>  "she's hoodooed you"

**Hoodoo** is a unique WordPress themeing framework with a built in ability to quickly build pages by utilizing pre-built components and templates. This in itself is not unique but Hoodoo ships with ACF which was utilized to allow frontend editing of all content. 

##Long Term Goal - WordPress as a CMS
The long term goal for Hoodoo is to have a client ready website built very quickly, and allow the client to stay on the frontend and to leave your wonderful configs and settings alone..plus its just less confusing for non-WordPress users.

## Todo

- NEED TO ADD DOCS! - In Progress
- Full Admin on Frontend - In Progress
- Look into Widgets for Drag & Drop

Pages must be named as a slug. Change Name of Page in Menu for viewing.

## The Code & Collab
As of right now this is in pre-beta and is **NOT** stable, as in **NOT** ready for production. You are welcome to fork take a look add/remove etc.

If you want to work on it please feel free to clone the directory at anytime, contact me at [zac@pointstart.us](mailto:zac@pointstart.us) to join the team!

### Phoenix - Bourbon Microframework
Phoenix is a Bourbon based Microframework used for quick templating of projects. Hoodoo is being developed alongside of Phoenix so they will work well together but Phoenix is slowly becoming a standalone project.
